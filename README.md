## Introduction

In this project i have created an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that write. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## Problem

 Employees  with access to sensitive data, i wanted to create a  randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria and provides greater security.


## Solution

For that i have created the page using HTML, CSS and Javascript with the following criteria:

GIVEN when  need a new, secure password

WHEN  clicked the button to generate a password

THEN  presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria

THEN  select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password

THEN  choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password

THEN  confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN  answer each prompt

THEN  input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered

THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated

THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
